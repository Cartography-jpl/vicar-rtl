This directory contains the code to build the VICAR RTL library. 

In the original MIPL code, the libraries libp2, libp1, librtl, libshvic, and 
libtae are separate libraries. However, they are never used except together. 
As a convenience, we put them all into one library. We also call this library
"libvicar_rtl" rather than "librtl" because there are other libraries 
that use the same "librtl" library name. We also stuff libmath77 into this
library, since again we don't need to use this library independently.

This directory contains a configure and Makefile, which can be used to
build just this code. However if you are building the full afids system, the
top level Makefile contains everything and you don't need a separate build
here.
