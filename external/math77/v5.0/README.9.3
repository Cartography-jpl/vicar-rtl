   Correct errors in write-up: Chap 9.3, Nonlinear Least-Squares,
   dated April 9, 1992.

   The subroutines do not return the final residual vector or the final
   Jacobian matrix.  To obtain the final residual vector the user must
   add code to compute the residual vector using the final solution
   coefficients.  If using DNLAxx, this can be done just by calling
   DCALCR.  If using DLNSxx, the user must call DCALCA to evaluate
   the functions Phi sub (i,j) of Alpha, and then execute code that
   uses these values, along with the final Beta's to compute residuals
   using the formulas of Equations 3 or 4 of page 9.3-2.

   All sentences, phrases, and table entries mentioning the symbolic
   indices "j" and "r" as indices into the IV() array should be deleted
   from the write-up.  On page 9.3-8 references occur in the table and
   following "B.4.2".  On page 9.3-10 references occur in subsection B.4.2.
