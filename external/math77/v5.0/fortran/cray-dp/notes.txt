To make a version of DINT for use on the CRAY in conjunction with
program units compiled with the "-dp" option, copy SINT* to a
separate directory, rename SINT*.* to DINT*.*, edit everything to
change SINT to DINT (except in comments).  Make sure KWORK is NOT
changed in ?INTMA.  Make sure NOT to clobber stuff in the non-CRAY
directory with the new stuff.
