Source directories are shared.  Only machine dependence is in lib/$VICCPU.

In theory amach.f might need to be changed for different architectures, but
in practice all current ones are close enough to IEEE not to matter.

ducomp.f and sucomp.f don't compile on g77 (linux or mac) but this seems not
to matter.  A few warnings about MAX should be safe to ignore.

Building for mac-osx:

select
set path=($path .)
set path=($path /usr/local/bin)		# just for g77
cd v5.0
mkdir lib/$VICCPU
make_osx.csh

Only difference between make.csh and make_osx.csh is use of g77 instead of f77.
